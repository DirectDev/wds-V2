    # the user after authentication, e.g. /connect/facebook?_destination=/my/destination will
    # redirect the user to /my/destination after facebook authenticates them.  If this is not
    # set then the user will be redirected to the original resource that they requested, or
    # the base address if no resource was requested.  This is similar to the behaviour of
